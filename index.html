      <h2>Upcoming Fundraiser</h2>
      <p>
        We’re hosting a clothing drive and fundraiser called <strong>Bee The Change Fund</strong> in support of the
        <strong>Behavioral Health Access Center</strong> at McKay-Dee Hospital.
      </p>
      <p>
        The event is scheduled for <strong>Saturday, November 15, from 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM</strong>, and we’re seeking a
        welcoming location — such as a lobby, community room, or outdoor space — to host the drive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to collect clothing and essential items for patients receiving behavioral health care, while also raising
        funds for much-needed supplies like leggings and T-shirts. We’ll gladly acknowledge your support with signage and will
        follow all facility guidelines or requirements.
